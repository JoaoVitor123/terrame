The installer script was generated with Inno Setup.

ModPath was used to provide extra features.

Some parameters should be checked before generating the installer, as follows:
1. #define MyAppVersion [version]
2. OutputBaseFilename=terrame-[version]-win[32|x64]
3. All "Source" in [Files] section must be checked.

To generate the installer just open the tme.iss in Inno Setup and compile it.
